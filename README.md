- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TanyaDemi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in "World peace!"
- ðŸŒ± I am an open-minded and critical thinker, making decisions based on facts. This mindset led me to advance my education in IT . Passed the basic Python course, began to study SQL.   I am looking for a full-time position in a company where I can be the foundational support of the companyâ€™s decision making. I will be glad to answer questions of those interested.
